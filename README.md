# ModelErrorOverestimation
Bayesian Analyses on the convergence patterns of Effective Field Theories and estimation of the uncertainty induced by a truncated expansion can be, in fact, overestimated under specific (yet easy to make!) assumptions.

There is a python file included which outlines the Emcee sampling of the posterior. Included also is the data file.

Simply download the data file and the python file, place them in the same directory, and use python to run the file.

Python dependencies include:

- numpy
- matplotlib
- emcee
- scipy 
- corner
